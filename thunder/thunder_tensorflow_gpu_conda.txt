Steps:
(1) Install Anaconda
(2) Create and activate a new conda env with tensorflow-gpu
(3) Install jupyter lab and other packages
(4) Run jupyter lab

(1)
# Retrieve and install Anaconda from home directory.
> cd ~
> wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.05-Linux-x86_64.sh

# Run the bash file after installing anaconda. 
> . ~/.bashrc

# After executing the .bashrc file, the (base) environment will become active.
# Deactivate the (base) environment before creating new environment. 
> conda deactivate

(2)
# Upload the .yaml file to thunder (remember the file location for next command).
# Create new conda environment using .yaml file.
> conda env create -f ~/conda-yaml/tf-gpu9.yaml

# Activate the new environment.
> conda activate tf-gpu9

# Confirm GPU access in conda environment with tensorflow.
> python -c 'import tensorflow as tf ; tf.config.list_physical_devices()'

 *** all steps below should have environment activated ***

(3)
# Install jupyter lab in the environment.
> conda install jupyterlab

(4)
# Launch jupyter lab.
> jupyter lab

# Create ssh-tunnel from local command line.
# Or upload and run script jupy.sh.
> ssh -N -f -L 8888:localhost:8888 jreynolds@thunder.cs.nor.ou.edu
